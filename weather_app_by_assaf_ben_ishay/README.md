## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
-   View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
-   See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
-   Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
-   View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
-   Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
-   Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
-   Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Now can also scroll between resulted cities in the dropdown result while searching.

## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   PC-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This challenge i've learned how to sync 3 different API's

### Continued development

At the beginning i've started this project using TypeScript,I would not recommend it to a beginner before diving in into the TS world.What I did actually learn is that is relatively easy to convert TypeScript project files to React JSX files.

##### [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)- ![](https://media.inkscape.org/static/images/inkscape-logo.svg)- This software helped me edit the svg file in order to make the entry animation.
